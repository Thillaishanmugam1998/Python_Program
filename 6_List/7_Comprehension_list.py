# Comprehension:
"""
    List comprehension is a very powerful programming tool. It is similar to set builder notation in mathematics. 
    It is a concise way to create new list by performing some kind of process on each item on existing list. 
    List comprehension is considerably faster than processing a list by for loop.

# List Comprehension Technique
